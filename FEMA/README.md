# FEMA

The Flavor Ingredient Library provides information on ingredients that have been determined to be generally recognized as safe under conditions of intended use as flavor ingredients by the FEMA Expert Panel. These two programs go though the entire FEMA database and stuff.

### This can be used on any list of CAS numbers. This program is not specific to FEMA.

## Dependencies

You will need to install:
cirpy
rdkit*
pandas

rdkit needs its own environment and therefore is treated seperatly.


## Installation

Use conda and/or pip to install dependencies. rdkit specifically needs  conda. 

## Usage

Convert a list of CAS numbers to SMILES.
Convert a list of SMILES to chemical fomula, molecular weight, and mol files. 
Export all this information to excel.
